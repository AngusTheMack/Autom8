# Ubuntu
My plan with this was to create a simple, and somewhat crude script that can be used to install a general base set of tools. Then I want to compare the ease of using a scripted installation versus other methods.

This installs the following:
* git
* C++
* pyenv
* python
* java
* VSCode
* VSCode extensions:
    * C++ tools
    * Java
    * Markdown
    * Python
    * Wakatime
