# Vagrant
This is a Vagrantfile for the following tools:
* c++
* git
* java
* pyenv
* python 2.7.15
* python 3.6.5

I came across Bogdan's [i-vagrant](https://github.com/bogdanvlviv/i-vagrant), which I took the `install-pyenv.sh` and `install-python.sh` scripts from in order to manage different versions of python easily.
